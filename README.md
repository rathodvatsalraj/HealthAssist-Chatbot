- **Datasets:**
  - [Symptom to Diagnosis Dataset by Gretel AI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gretelai/symptom_to_diagnosis?row=2)
  - [Symptom to Diagnosis Dataset by Zabihin](https://huggingface.co/Zabihin/Symptom_to_Diagnosis?text=I%27ve+been+feeling+really+run+down+and+weak.+My+throat+is+sore+and+I%27ve+been+coughing+a+lot.+I%27ve+also+been+having+chills+and+a+fever)

- **Model:**
  - [Symptom to Diagnosis Prediction Model by Zabihin](https://huggingface.co/Zabihin/Symptom_to_Diagnosis?text=I%27ve+been+feeling+really+run+down+and+weak.+My+throat+is+sore+and+I%27ve+been+coughing+a+lot.+I%27ve+also+been+having+chills+and+a+fever)
